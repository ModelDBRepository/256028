which also includes a link to a binder where the model can be run on the web:<p/>

Once you have started the binder you can navigate the index where a nice menu of figures exists as captured in the below image:<p/>

For example clicking on the figure 2 link leads to a python notebook which when the cells are executed generates these images:<p/>
